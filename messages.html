            Youre rich! You're used to being above law, but compared to Cult Leader Musk, you’re poor, which gets rid of your privileges. There’s a set of rules you have to follow to not be thrown off the deck (you certainly won’t like to be in the lone, desolate and freezing space).
            <br><br>
            RULE 1
            Free spech is only available to Elon Musk. The savior loves expressing his views in his tweets. He is always right.
            <br><br>
            RULE 2
            The only social media app available in space is Twitter. The company recommends using it to express rightist radical views.
            <br><br>
            RULE 3
            Theres two topics you cant mention. Boss forgotten promise to end world hunger and his ex partners. He doesn’t like being held accountable :(
